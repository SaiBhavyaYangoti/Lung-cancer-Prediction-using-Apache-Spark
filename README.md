# Lung-cancer-Prediction-using-Apache-Spark

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of lung cancer using machine learning models built with Apache Spark. The dataset includes medical and lifestyle features such as age, gender, smoking history, and other symptoms. The objective is to create a scalable and accurate predictive model leveraging PySparkâ€™s MLlib to process and analyze data efficiently.

The project was executed on a single-node Spark cluster set up locally, which allowed parallel processing and faster computation. Data preprocessing, feature transformation, model training, and evaluation were all performed using Spark's distributed capabilities. Models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest were tested, with performance metrics used to select the best model for deployment in potential healthcare applications.
